The Supermarket Billing System is a simple console-based application 
that simulates the process of adding items to a cart, calculating totals, and 
printing bills. This mini project focuses on implementing the billing 
mechanism using the stack data structure, following a Last-In-First-Out 
(LIFO) approach.
